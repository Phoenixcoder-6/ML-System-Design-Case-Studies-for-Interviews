# ðŸ§  1. Problem Understanding & Goal Framing

## 1. Objective:
Design a recommendation system for YouTube that effectively handles the cold-start problem for newly uploaded videos, ensuring they reach the right users with minimal delay.

## 2. Business Goal:
1. Maximize user engagement: Increase click-throughs, watch time, and session duration.
   
2. Improve content discovery: Ensure new content is discoverable, especially from small or emerging creators.
   
3. Support creator growth: Drive early traction to newly uploaded content, keeping creators motivated and active.

## 3. Key Metrics (KPIs):

## 3. Data Strategy

### Data Collection: 

1. Content metadata: title, tags, category, description, upload time

2. Channel info: creator history, number of subscribers, past video performance

3. User context: watch history, demographic profile, device, time of day

### Multimodal content:

1. Text: Title, description â†’ BERT embeddings

2. Visuals: Thumbnail â†’ CNN embeddings (ResNet, EfficientNet)

3. Audio/Transcript: Auto-generated captions â†’ NLP-based content features


 ### Preprocessing:

1. Normalize timestamps and extract freshness features

2. Clean and embed textual metadata

3. Generate content embeddings (offline) for new videos

### Labeling Strategy:

1. Use past video recommendations as positive/negative pairs: >70% watch time-> Positive label, Else -> Negative Label

2. For cold-start: Bootstrap using engagement patterns of similar videos or channels


## ðŸ¤– 4. Modeling Strategy


## Phase 1: Baseline

#### Content-based filtering: 

1. Cosine similarity of video embeddings (title/tags/thumbnail) with user history
   
2. Fast, zero-dependency on user interaction data
   

## Phase 2: Hybrid System (Recommended)

### Candidate Generation:

1. Two-Tower Model:

 - > User tower: Learns embeddings from watch history, context

- > Item tower: Learns embeddings from metadata, uploader features

- > Use dot product or learned similarity function

Fast retrieval using FAISS or ScaNN

2. Ranking Layer:

- > Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost/LightGBM) or Deep MLP

- > Inputs: Click probability, video freshness, content quality scores, recency features

- > Output: Final score for re-ranking candidates

3. Cold-Start Specific Enhancements:

- > Uploader priors: Boost score if the uploader has strong historical engagement

- > Meta-learning: Predict early video performance from metadata using few-shot modeling

- > Exploration mechanism: Inject promising new videos into a small % of user feeds and learn quickly via early feedback loops
